# VeriRISC-processor
### This repo will contain the modules used to do a VeriRISC processor using Verilog with their test benches and results.

_The architecture used is called very-reduced-instruction-set processor **(VeriRISC)**. Its instruction consists of a three-bit operation code and a five-bit operand. That restricts its instruction set to eight instructions and its address space to 32 locations. You can find a schematic for the architecture in the figure below and you will find the Verilog codes for all the components attached in this repo._
